    of Tasks.

    no longer needed. Each Environment defines a start and end *Action* — a command/script

    Environment.  The actions for these environments, as with all actions, are each
    run in their own operating system process.

    logging generated by the Session itself, are forwarded to the Open Job Description sessions
